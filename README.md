🍽️ Eatap (Phase 2)

Eatap is an online food ordering system focused on nearby mess services for college students.
Unlike platforms like Zomato or Swiggy, Eatap helps students discover affordable, home-style food from local mess providers.

This project is being developed collaboratively as a full-stack application using React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

    Simple, fast, and affordable food ordering
    
    Focus on locality-based discovery
    
    Easy-to-use UI for students and mess owners
